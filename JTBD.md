# WHEN -- THEY WANT TO -- SO THAT

1. WHEN a user has special needs,
   THEY WANT TO indicate their needs,
   SO THAT the airline can provide those special accommodations.
2. WHEN a user is no longer able to go on a scheduled flight,
   THEY WANT TO cancel their ticket,
   SO THAT they can get their money back for the ticket
3. WHEN a user is no longer able to go on a scheduled flight,
   THEY WANT TO reschedule their flight,
   SO THAT they can get a time that they can make.
4. WHEN a user wants to sit at a particular seat,
   THEY WANT TO select a seat,
   SO THAT they feel comfortable during the trip.
5. WHEN a user has too much luggage,
   THEY WANT TO indicate extra add ons,
   SO THAT the airline can accommodate their extra baggages.
6. WHEN a user decides on making the reservation,
   THEY WANT TO add a personâ€™s name/personal information,
   SO THAT the reservation belongs to that person.
7. WHEN a user wants to verify their flight,
   THEY WANT TO view their reservation,
   SO THAT they can have reassurance.
